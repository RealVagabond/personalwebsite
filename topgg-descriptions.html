    <h3>So lots of bots out there have websites. Some are just static pages, some are dashboards, and some are literally just portals to their patreon pages.

If you made a website for your bot, and you are trying to figure out how to get around the whole "300 min Character" issue, here's what I did for <marktopgg><a href="https://top.gg/bot/805719891431784459"target="AssetX">AssetX.</a></marktopgg>
     </h3>

<h3>
First, you're just going to have to make a short description of your bot consiting of at least 300 characters. You should have this already if you have a website, so just copy and paste that above where the website will go.
<br>
<br>
Example:
<br>
<img src="<images></blog-bot-page>.png"
     class="img"
     width="450"
     height="250">
</h3>
<br>
<h3>
  Then, copy and paste this, replacing my website's URL with yours.
</h3>

<div class="blog-topgg-container">
  <h3>
    <li><strong>Just take out the space between the 1st and last < and iframe</strong></a></li>
    <br>
    <br>
    < iframe src="Insert Website URL Here" title="Insert Website Name Here" width="100%">
    < /iframe>
    </h3>
</div>

<h3>Once you have your 300-character bot description, and that iframe code snippet from above, it should work!
<br>
<br>
It will look something like this: yadyayadadyady
