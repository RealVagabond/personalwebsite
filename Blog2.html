        <h1> 9/5/21 - Building this Website </h1> 

    <h3>
    Prior to starting this site, I knew absolutely nothing about Web Development. I still don't, but at least I'm slightly less clueless than before. I'm using basic Html and CSS to make this portfolio site of mine, nothing too fancy!

<h2>
Day 1
</h2>
    <h3>
    I spent the first day pretty much just setting up Visual Studio, creating a Github Repo, and figuring out basic Markdown and HTML for text formatting. 

    </h3>
<h2>
    Day 2
</h2>

    <h3>
        Day 2 consisted of figuring out how to make the Twitter, Instagram, Github, and Discord buttons work on the front page. This took way too long, but it was well worth it. After completing that, I worked super hard to try and figure out padding and how that all worked. Turns out, it really sucks to format things exactly the way oyu want them, especially with Html. 
    </h3>
<h2>
    Day 3
</h2>
    <h3>
        I spent most of day 3 working on getting the header with "Projects, Gallery, and Blog" to be formatted correctly. It was leaning off to the left side, and I had no idea why. Ironically, I still don't know why but thanks to helpful friends on Discord it got fixed it up. 
    </h3>
<h2>
    Day 4
</h2>
    <h3>
        My mind is BLOWN. Some people suggested I check out <mark><a href="https://replit.com">Replit</a></mark>, <mark><a href="https://jsfiddle.net">JSFiddle</a></mark>, and <mar><a href="https://fontawesome.com">Fontawesome</a></mark>, and it's definitely a huge discovery for me. Been using them all day, very helpful.
