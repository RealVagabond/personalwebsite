<br>

<h3> 
    I became a Discord Partner in March of 2020, for <a href="https://discord.gg/photography" target="blank"><i class="fas fa-location-arrow fa-xs"></i> Photography Lounge.</a> 
    I created the server on July 4th, which means that I grew the server from 0 members to Discord Partner in 9 months. 
    Despite being a Discord Partner, I can't guarantee that the information I share can be applied to your server, 
    especially because Discord keeps its specific vetting process private.

<h2><i class="far fa-lightbulb"></i> Things to keep in mind</h2>
<br>
<h3>To be honest, becoming a Discord partner is far more random than most think. 
  I applied to the partner program 3 times on the same server before being accepted. 
  You have to be in the right place, at the right time, being reviewed by the right Discord staff member. 
<br>
<br>
  It's also generally a good idea to not make partnership your main goal when creating or managing a community. 
  Focus on your community's members and infrastructure. 
  This means having a place for members to send suggestions, speaking on a daily basis with them to hear their thoughts, and then making improvements to your server based on their concerns or preferences. 
  By no means does this mean that you need to act on everyone's suggestions, but maintaining an open dialogue and making people feel heard, is vital. I've also noticed that unless you have a significant audience off of Discord, you probably won't get partnered until you're above 1k members. 
  I won't say that it's impossible, but I have yet to see a partnered server that is discord-native get accepted under that landmark.

<h2><i class="fas fa-tasks"></i> What's next</h2>
<br>
<h3>Reading Discord's official content such as their Moderator Academy curriculum, as well as joining meta communities on Discord, will put you in the correct mindset. 
  Aligning yourself with Discord's official approaches and guidelines will set up apart from the masses and put you on the right track. 
  Some good meta communities I enjoy are <a href="https://discord.gg/displace" target="_blank"><i class="fas fa-location-arrow fa-xs"></i> Displace</a> & <a href="https://discord.gg/ownershub" target="_blank"><i class="fas fa-location-arrow fa-xs"></i> Owners Hub</a>. 
  If you want to get more involved with Moderation, <a href="https://dmod.gg/discord" target="_blank"><i class="fas fa-location-arrow fa-xs"></i> Dmod</a> is a great place to do that.
<br>
<br>
If your community is small, housing anywhere between 100-900 members, I recommend aiming to deliver quality experience to your members. 
Do some sort of weekly event, make bi-weekly update announcements, and focus on really communicating with your members on a personal level while maintaining a professional image. 
Finding community members whom you trust over extended periods will be vital. 
The bigger you get, the more you'll need to share responsibilities with other people. 
Super-Moderators, Event Managers, Social Media Managers, and more. 
A promising time frame for going from 1 to 1,000 members is 10 months. 
If you can reach that landmark sooner than that, great! If not, that's also perfectly fine. 
Perhaps your community's niche is small on Discord. 
That said, if your server has a very popular focus (such as gaming or coding), and you haven't been able to reach 1k members within 10 months then it probably means you're not providing a unique enough experience to your members. 
<br>
<br>
If your community is larger, housing anywhere between 1,000-100k members, you should probably focus on finding a healthy balance between delivering quality and quantity. 
You want a staff team that can handle a larger amount of traffic, but you don't want them paying so much attention to your members that they burn out. 
You'll want to pay a lot more attention to your team. 
Picking the right people that will essentially be embodying what you used to do when the community was small. 
Find kind people who are willing to help on an individual level, but who can also set boundaries for themselves and their mental health. 
Create staff guidelines, update your community rules, set up anti-nuke and anti-raid bots such as <a href="https://beemo.gg" target="_blank"><i class="fas fa-location-arrow fa-xs"></i> Beemo</a> and <a href="https://wickbot.com" target="_blank"><i class="fas fa-location-arrow fa-xs"></i> Wick.</a>
Creating a break channel full of mental health and anti-burnout resources is a great touch when trying to figure out how to make your staff member's jobs easier. 
Plus if you have the ability to, actually paying your moderators is truly great.
In short, you want to create an environment and community which really impresses whoever will join your server trying to figure out whether or not you're viable for Discord Partnership. 
Look for problems, listen to member feedback, and evolve.
