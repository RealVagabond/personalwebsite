# My First Website

Written in Html & CSS. 

## 🔨 Tools I'm using

I'm using VSC, Replit, Notion, JSFiddle, & W3Schools.

## 🌐 Domain & Host

Not sure for either of these yet, for a host I'll be using [Vercel](https://vercel.com) but I haven't figured out what domain I want to use yet. 

## 🤔 Can I use this code as a template?

I guess you could, I'm using [this website](https://ven.earth) as a reference point for mine, but I'm not stealing anything. I would recommend you try and make your own site from scratch if you're a beginner like I am because you'll learn so much.
