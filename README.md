Welcome to my first website, and first public repo :)
I'm trying to great something similar to this site just so I can have a clear goal to start.
Going to be using good ol'

HTML
CSS
JS (not yet, but I'm pretty sure that's required to make a site)
Eventually I'll branch into things like Vue and React, but I thought I might as well lay the groundwork with this project first.
