# My First Website

Written in Html & CSS. 

## üî® Tools I'm using

I'm using [Visual Studio](https://code.visualstudio.com), [Replit](https://replit.com), [Notion](https://notion.so), [JSFiddle](https://jsfiddle.net), & [W3Schools](https://w3schools.com).

## ‚úçüèº Blog Posts

All code on the site is perfectly ok, but please do not copy or claim the blog posts I've written. All of the text, images, resources are made or curated by me, so I think it's fair enough to keep that protected. That being said, feel free to use the pages as templates though.  

## üåê Domain & Host

For now, I'm using [Surge](https://surge.sh) which allows me to host the [Website](https://vagabondit.surge.sh) and it comes with a Tier 3 Domain for free. Eventually I'd love to use something like Vercel, but since the project isn't complete yet, and I'm low on money, this is what I'm using and it works really well!



## ü§î Can I use this code as a template?

I guess you could, I'm using [this website](https://ven.earth) as a reference point for mine, but I'm not blatantly copying anything. Because I'm a beginner, I want to use another site as sort of a crutch while I get the hang of things, and eventually I'll make the site individualistic. I would recommend you try and make your own site from scratch if you're a beginner like I am because you'll learn way quicker and better.
