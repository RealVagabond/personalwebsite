# üö´ Issues

We do have some issues to overcome, but we're constantly racking our brains on how to get past these.

- **~~Lack of Developers~~**

    ~~I'm pretty much looking for Python bot developers every single day, we're bound to find one soon!~~

    ~~If you think you might know someone, here are the requirements:~~

    - ~~Experience with Python~~
    - ~~Experience with creating Discord Bots~~
    - ~~Experience with finance in general, or Cryptocurrencies and Stocks.~~

    A proficient Python & Frontend developer came on board, I think we're good for now!

- **Known Bugs**
    - Slash Commands for Stocks don't work sometimes
    - Ticker symbols won't work for crypto tokens
    - Bot's prefix doesn't reset in the guild once it's been kicked in case it rejoins

# üåÅ Goals

- **AssetX Website**
    - Having a website, with a dashboard is definitely on our list of things to do. We would need to find a full-stack web developer to make this happen, and unless we get really lucky, we'd need some funding to pay them to make this happen.
    - Short-term goal is a simple dashboard just handling basic commands. Long-term goal is to make a Trading View alternative.

- **Pro Features**

    We're wanting to add the following:

    - Buy and Sell signals
    - Trend Change Alerts
    - Momentum Stock Alerts
    - Options & Common Stock Trade Alerts (Long Term)
    - Real-Time Buy and Sell Alerts
    - Chart Pattern Recognition
    - Breakout Stock & Bottoming patterns

    Most of these require paid APIs, so we'll need to figure out which pro features we can make for free before moving onto the paid ones. 

- **Dedicated News & Price Alerts**

    We're currently working on price alerts for both Cryptocurrencies and Stocks, and once we finish that we'll move onto daily News alerts which will be delivered to you in DMs.

    Sneak Peak üëÄ

# üóì Conclusion

- **First Order of Business**

    Finishing up Price & News Alerts. Caasi should be done with Price alerts by the end of the day, and News alerts might take a bit longer depending on if he bumps into any issues. 

- **Second Order of Business**

    The second order of business is a tough one because it's a pretty major hoop to jump through. We need to pick and choose which premium features to release which don't cost us anything, so we can earn some money, and spend it on premium features that do cost money. 

    Productivity will hopefully pick up here if the team sees that users are passionate about the project.
