    <h2>Starting out.
    </h2>
    <h3>
In the beginning, the decisions you'll have to make will vary greatly depending on what niche you're server will be in. 
My only partnered server is a <a href="https://discord.gg/Photography">Photography Server</a>, 
and I made it during a period when there was max 2 Photography-focused servers over 1k members. 
Needless to say, the niche was mostly untouched.

First, you're just going to have to make a short description of your bot consiting of at least 300 characters. You should have this already if you have a website, so just copy and paste that above where the website will go.
<br>
<br>
Example:
<br>
<img src="<images></blog-bot-page>.png"
     class="img"
     width="450"
     height="250">
</h3>
<br>
<h3>
  Then, copy and paste this, replacing my website's URL with yours.
</h3>

<div class="blog-topgg-container">
  <h3>
    <li><strong>Just take out the space between the 1st and last < and iframe</strong></a></li>
    <br>
    <br>
    < iframe src="Insert Website URL Here" title="Insert Website Name Here" width="100%">
    < /iframe>
    </h3>
</div>

<h3>Once you have your 300-character bot description, and that iframe code snippet from above, it should work!
<br>
<br>
It will look something like this: yadyayadadyady
