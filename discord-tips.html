    <h2>Starting out.
    </h2>

    <h3>
There is a checklist of criteria you'll want to review before starting your community. 
<br>
<br>

• Is the niche empty, or can you bring something truly unique to it?
<br>
• Do you have enough time to dedicate to managing a new community?
<br>
• Are you familiar with good Moderation practices already?

<br>
<br>
<br>
Unfortunately, due to the sheer size of these niches, Gaming, Community, Meme, 
<br>
& Emoji communities are pretty much not worth getting into.
