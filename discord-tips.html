    <h2>Starting out.

    <h3>
In the beginning, the decisions you'll have to make will vary greatly depending on what niche you're server will be in. 
My only partnered server is a <a href="https://discord.gg/Photography">Photography Server</a>, 
and I made it during a period when there was max 2 Photography-focused servers over 1k members. 
Needless to say, the niche was mostly untouched.
