    <h2>Before you start
    </h2>
    <br>
    <h3>
There is a checklist of criteria you'll want to review before starting your community. 
<br>
<br>

• Is the niche empty, or can you bring something truly unique to it?
<br>
• Do you have enough time to dedicate to managing a new community?
<br>
• Are you familiar with good Moderation practices?

<br>
<br>
Due to the sheer size of these niches, Gaming, Community, Meme, 
<br>
& Emoji communities aren't realy worth getting into. 
     </h3>
     

<h2>
  Starting out
</h2>
<br>
<h3>
When you're first starting out you'll be making many decisions right off the bat. Who will your moderators be? 
How many roles should there be? What bots should I use? What rules should I enforce? 
<br>
<br>
Don't hire moderators yet, growth will be slow in the beginning anyway and the chances you won't be around to handle a issue are slim. 
Start off with 5-10 roles, this way members don't have too much to learn and things are super simple. 
Use <a href="https://mee6.xyz"target=Mee6">Mee6</a> as your first bot, because it's multipurpose and gets the job done. 

</h3>

<h2>Figuring out Moderation</h2>
<br>
<h3>
Moderation varies from server to server depending on niche, size, and leadership. 
Take a look at how other servers in your niche are run and make a decision from there. 
If you like how common servers are run, model yours off of theirs. 
If you don't, make changes that improve on competitor's moderation methods. 
It wouldn't hurt to also check out <a href="https://discord.com/moderation"target="DMA">Discord's Moderator Academy</a>,and the <a href="https://modcast.network"target=Modcast Podcast">Modcast Podcast</a> to familiarize yourself with industry level standards. 
<br>
<br>
Once you figure out how you want your community to be moderated, find members that fit the mold of a perfect member and see if they want to be a community moderator. 
It's most common to open applications to see who wants to moderate, 
but if you plan on growing your server significantly to the point that you won't be able to open moderator applications, 
you might want to keep scalability in mind and hand pick moderators.
