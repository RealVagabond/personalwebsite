      <h1> Guide to Discord Community Management</h1>

    <h2>Before you start
    </h2>
  <br>
    <h3>
There is a checklist of criteria you'll want to review before starting your community. 
  <br>
  <br>

• Is the niche empty, or can you bring something truly unique to it?
  <br>
• Do you have enough time to dedicate to managing a new community?
  <br>
• Are you familiar with good Moderation practices?

  <br>
  <br>
Due to the sheer size of these niches, Gaming, Community, Meme, 
<br>
& Emoji communities aren't realy worth getting into. 
     </h3>
     

<h2>
  Starting out
</h2>
  <br>
<h3>
When you're first starting out you'll be making many decisions right off the bat. Who will your moderators be? 
How many roles should there be? What bots should I use? What rules should I enforce? 
  <br>
  <br>
Don't hire moderators yet, growth will be slow in the beginning anyway and the chances you won't be around to handle a issue are slim. 
Start off with 5-10 roles, this way members don't have too much to learn and things are super simple. 
Use <a href="https://mee6.xyz"target=Mee6">Mee6</a> as your first bot, because it's multipurpose and gets the job done.

<h2>Figuring out Moderation</h2>
  <br>
<h3>
Moderation varies from server to server depending on niche, size, and leadership. 
Take a look at how other servers in your niche are run and make a decision from there. 
If you like how common servers are run, model yours off of theirs. 
If you don't, make changes that improve on competitor's moderation methods. 
It wouldn't hurt to also check out <a href="https://discord.com/moderation"target="DMA">Discord's Moderator Academy</a>,and the <a href="https://modcast.network"target=Modcast Podcast">Modcast Podcast</a> to familiarize yourself with industry level standards. 
  <br>
  <br>
Once you figure out how you want your community to be moderated, find members that fit the mold of a perfect member and see if they want to be a community moderator. 
It's most common to open applications to see who wants to moderate, 
but if you plan on growing your server significantly to the point that you won't be able to open moderator applications, 
you might want to keep scalability in mind and hand pick moderators.

<h2>Time to improve</h2>
  <br>
  <br>

<h3>
Now that you've defined your community's niche, 
set up the bots you'll need, and figured out your moderation system, 
it's just time to build on what you already have. 
All you need to do, is check out the other servers in your niche. 
Do some digging on <a href="https://disboard.org"target=Disboard>Disboard</a> to find your competitors. 
  <br>
  <br>

Once you figure out who your competitors are, try and understand why they have more members or more activity than you. 
Are they backed by an external traffic source like a YouTube chanel or Subreddit? 
Do they pay for ads in other communities?
Do they do Nitro giveaways?
Perhaps they've just been around longer. 
Regardless, look at how their channels are set up, how their moderation is set up, 
how they handle events or how often they announce server updates and see what you ca incorporate in your own server.
</h3>


<h2> Maintaining Activity and Interest</h2>
  <br>  
  <br>

<h3> From my experience, maintaning momentum is nearly impossible for longer than a few months at a time. 
  Like most things in life, running a community on Discord is like surfing; you ride waves and then you go through lulls. 
Throughout this, it's important to not loose motivation during the lulls. 
These down periods can last anywhere between a few days, and a few weeks, but there are still things you can do to recover from them stronger than the lat time.
  <br>
  <br>
Weekly or bi-weekly events are extremely useful, as they can motivate members to come back to the server with reason and purpose. 
For my Photography server, we have weekly photo contests where people submit their newest pictures in hopes of winning server points, nitro, and roles. 

Nitro giveaways, while cliche, are definitely useful. 
They're act as quick injections of activity that can keep people glued to the server for a solid day or two. 
I wouldn't do these too too often though, as it debases the rarity and sense of eventfullness.

Fun bots such as Melonpan and Dankmemer can also help maintain activity. 
Just be sure that people aren't popping in everyday just for those bots unless it fits in theme for what your server is about.
