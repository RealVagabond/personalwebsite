      <h1> How Slavery Continues to Effect African Americans Today </h1>

    <h3>Last Updated: 2/6/21 • 2 min read</h3>


    <h3>
  The enslavement and emancipation of African Americans has had a huge impact on the Black Americans of today. According to “Pew Research Center”, only 16% of American adults think that slavery doesn’t affect African Americans today.
  Only 9% of African Americans believe that slavery doesn’t affect them today.
<br>
<br>

To understand how racism still affects Black Americans today, we need to first understand racism. 
At the core of the issue, lies a human need to feel superior. 
Races, cultures, towns, cities, families, people, companies, teams, schools, all are wired to look for who they are superior to. 
The belief that someone else is below you, no matter whether or not they actually are. 
Slavery was a byproduct of racism, and it helped fuel and elongate the false superiority that was developed centuries earlier. 
If the United States had banned slavery from the start, perhaps America would have become one of the few places where racism became non-existent. 
Despite the United States being a progressive nation when it was founded, both the need to build a new country and economy, along with the need to feel superior, allowed slavery to become a core part of the early American story. 
<br>
<br>
An external example of a superiority dynamic is in Italy. 
The Milanese look down on the Florentines, the Florentines look down on the Romans, the Romans look down on the Neapolitans, and the Neapolitans look down on the Sardinians. 
The North to South power and superiority dynamic is objectively wrong because each culture has their own strengths and weaknesses, as well as different ideas of what makes a culture superior or not. 
Regardless, this has existed for centuries and it’s still the case today.
<br>
<br>
Now that racism has been covered, we can better understand how slavery still affects African Americans today. 
The slavery which originally took place because of the need for White Americans to keep a feeling of superiority, prolonged and promoted the idea of racism as a concept. 
The remaining systematic racism is showcased in government resource distribution, police racial profiling, racially unbalanced poverty rates, real estate segregation, and many more important aspects of modern American life.  
African Americans are still being discriminated against. 
Even higher and better-funded education is unbalanced, blatantly favoring White Americans. 
<br>
<br>
What racism did, was prolong the history of discrimination and superiority enforced by whites.  
Specifically, it's what created slavery in the first place. 
If the country was initially founded with more progressive ethics that went beyond a need to feel superior, perhaps racism wouldn't exist anymore here; 
unfortunately that’s not what happened.
